### C.  MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD
Maximum likelihood is an approach for estimating parameters for a statistical model.
It is also one of the most commonly used methods for phylogenetic reconstruction.
In this exercise, we will use maximum likelihood to identify DNA substitution models that best fit our sequence data. 
We will then use one of these models to test phylogenetic hypotheses about the distribution of traits among the bacteria in our study system. 

* following a lot of what's on following links: 
* http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/vignettes/Trees.pdf##
* http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/vignettes/Trees.pdf
*  http://www.slideshare.net/KlausVigo/phylogenetics-cibio

* need to think about the "exclude = pairwise" command in the dist.ml function below. 
*  also need to get a better handle on what `optim.pml` is doing
*  and also GTR. 
*  should have a few sentence desription here saying that we're going to take a peak at a few different substitution model, before more on to investigating all. 

### i.  Comparing Two Models 
In the previous section, we used saturation plots and cophylogenetic trees to visualize the effect of a DNA substitution model on our data. 
Here, we will test whether or not the K80 phylogeny is better than the raw phylogeny using maximum likelihood. 
```{r}
# Read in FASTA-Aligned File as a Matrix
read.aln.mat <- as.matrix(read.aln) 

# Convert FASTA-Aligned File into a phyDat Object {phangorn}
read.aln.phydat <- phyDat(read.aln.mat, type = "DNA") 

# Test and Evaluate Substitution Models
model.tests <- modelTest(read.aln.phydat) 
sort.tests <- model.tests[order(model.tests$AIC),] 
best.model <- sort.tests[1,1]

# Make Best Tree
tree.raw.mle <- nj(dist.logDet(read.aln.phydat)) 
best.tree  <- optim.pml(tree.raw.mle, model=best.model)

best.tree <- eval(get(model.tests$Model[which.min(model.tests$AIC)], env), env)
best.tree <- eval(get(model.tests$Model[which.min(model.tests$AIC)], env), env)

# Make Neighbor Joining Tree via Pairwise Distance for phyDat Object {phangorn}
tree.raw.mle <- nj(dist.logDet(read.aln.phydat)) 

# Identify Outgroup
outgroup <- match("Methanosarcina", tree.raw.mle$tip.label)

# Root Tree {ape}
rooted.raw.mle <- root(tree.raw.mle, outgroup, resolve.root=TRUE)

# Maximum Likelihood function {phangorn} returns tree, data, output
tree.JC.mle <- pml(rooted.raw.mle, read.aln.phydat) 

# Optimizes model parmameters {phangorn}
tree.JC.opt <- optim.pml(tree.JC.mle, TRUE) 
```

Now let's explore some of the output from the maximum liklihood analysis to see which of the few models best fits our data. 

```{r}
# anova(tree.raw.mle, tree.JC.mle, tree.JC.opt)
# AIC(fit.JC, fit.JC.opt, fit.GTR, fit.GTR.opt)
# SH.test(fit.JC, fit.JC.opt, fit.GTR, fit.GTR.opt)
```

### ii.  Identifying the "Best" Model
Now let's evaluate all of the DNA substitution models available to us and see which one best fits our data. 
This analysis is somewhat computationally intensive. 
It may take a couple of minutes to run. 
Be patient.
When this is done, we can see which DNA substituion model maximum likelihood determined to be the best.

```{r}
model.tests <- modelTest(read.aln.phydat) # {phangorn}
sort.tests <- model.tests[order(model.tests$AIC),] # order by AIC
best.model <- sort.tests[1,1]
env <- attr(model.tests, "env")
fitStart <- eval(get(model.tests$Model[which.min(model.tests$AIC)], env), env)

# outgroup <- match("Methanosarcina", fitStart$tip.label)
# fit.best.rooted <- root(fitStart, outgroup, resolve.root=TRUE)
# fitStart.rooted <- root(fitStart, outgroup, resolve.root=TRUE) # reroots the tree

fit.best <- optim.pml(fitStart, optNni=TRUE, optGamma=TRUE, optInv=TRUE, model="GTR")
# fit.best.rooted <- root(fit.best, outgroup, resolve.root=TRUE)
# bs <- bootstrap.pml(fit.best, bs=2, optNni=TRUE, multicore=TRUE) ### took long time (10 mins)
# par(mar=c(.1,.1,.1,.1))
# plotBS(fit.best$tree, bs) #{phangorn}

write nexus; write newick
```

### C. Obtaining Bootstrap Support for the Tree
Describe what bootstrapping is, how it's done, and how to interpret. 
Somewhat slow process (2 mins)
Read up on arguments

```{r}
# bs <- bootstrap.pml(fit.JC, bs = 100, optNni = TRUE,
#             control = pml.control(trace = 0)) #{phangorn}  
```

### Make tree with bootstrap support values 
There is apparently a problem here. plotBS hangs forever

```{r}
# par(mar=c(.1,.1,.1,.1))
# plotBS(fit.JC$tree, bs) #{phangorn}
```

http://grokbase.com/t/r/r-help/12876aby2z/r-how-to-write-out-a-tree-file-with-bootstrap-from-phangorn-package
"tree <- plotBS(fittree, bs)
You can export than this tree using write.tree or write.nexus, e.g. write.tree(tree)"
