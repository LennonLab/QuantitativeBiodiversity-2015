## RETRIEVING AND SETTING YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY
```{r}


```
## USING R AS A CALCULATOR
addition
```{r}


```
subtraction
```{r}


```
multiplication (with exponent)
```{r}


```
division (using a built-in constant)
```{r}


```
trigonometry with a simple built-in *function* (i.e., 'sin') and *argument* (i.e., '4')
```{r}


```
logarithms (another example of function and argument)
```{r}


```
## DEFINING VARIABLES
In R, you will often find it useful and necessary to assign values to a variable. Generally speaking, it's best to use '<-' rather than '=' as an assignment operator.
```{r}


```
What is the value of b?
```{r}


```
Now what is the value of b? Can you explain? Fix? It can help to examine variables with the following function 
```{r}


```
You can clear variables from R memory with following function (example of nested function)
```{r}


```
You can also examine variables in the Environment windwow of R Studio. By clikcing 'clear' in this window, you can erase variables from memory

## WORKING WITH SCALARS, VECTORS, AND MATRICES
Create a *scalar* by assigning a numeric value to a character
```{r}


```
A *vector* (or array) is a one-dimensional row of numeric values. You can create a vector in R
like this:
```{r}


```
What is the function 'c'? The `help()` function is your friend.
```{r}


```
What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar?
```{r}


```
What happens when you multiply two vectors?
```{r}


```
Here is how you reference an element in a vector
```{r}


```
Here is how you reference multiple elements in a vector
```{r}


```
Here is how you can change the value of an element in a vector
```{r}


```
It's pretty easy to perform summary statistics on a vector using built-in fuctions
```{r}




```
What happens when you take the standard error of the mean (sem) of z? Sometimes you need to make your own functions:
```{r}



```
Often, datasets have missing values (designated as 'NA' in R)
```{r}



```
What happens when you apply your sem function to vector i? One solution is to tell R to remove NA from the dataset:
```{r}



```
There are three common ways to create a matrix (two dimensional vectors) in R. **Approach 1** is to combine (or concatenate) two or more vectors. Let's start by creating a vector using a new function 'rnorm'
```{r}



```
What does the rnorm function do? What are arguments doing?
Now we will use the function 'cbind' to create a matrix
```{r}



```
Use the 'help' function to learn about cbind
Use the 'dim' function to describe the matrix you just created 

**Approach 2** to making a matrix is to use the matrix function:
```{r}



```
**Approach 3** to making a matrix is to import or 'load' a dataset from  your working directory (or elsewhere)
```{r}



```
Often, when handling datasets, we want to be able to transpose a matrix. This is easy in R:
```{r}



```
Also, you will find that you need to subset data in a matrix:

For example, maybe you want to take first three rows of a matrix:
```{r}



```

Or maybe you want the first two columns of a matrix:
```{r}



```
Or perhaps you want non-sequential columns of a matrix:
```{r}



```

**Student Questions**

## Basic Plotting
Included in R and various R packages are some basic datasets that are useful for testing functions and learning about R features and functions. One such dataset is *cars*. To learn about this dataset you can simple use the `{r} help` function

```{r}
help(cars)
```

Use the `{r} summary()' function to see basic summary statistics about this dataset

```{r}
summary(cars)
```


To visualize this data you can generate a simple plot with the `{r} plot()` function

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.'


## Other Useful Features and Fucntions: Sorting, Subsetting, Sampling

**Sorting**
We can use another dataset (mtcars) to practice sorting (ordering) data. Learn about mtcars via `{r} help(mtcars)`

sort by mpg
```{r}
newdata <- mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg),]
```

sort by mpg and cyl
```{r}
newdata <- mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl),]
```

sort by mpg (ascending) and cyl (descending)
```{r}
newdata <- mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg, - mtcars$cyl),]
```

Now, Let's make a new vector of data
```{r}
z <- c(1.5, 1/6, 1/3)
```

If we only want to view  the first two decimal places of z

```{r}
round(z,2)
```

Now, we can reverse the order of the elements in z
```{r}
rev(z)
```

And we can order z from smallest to largest
```{r}
sort(z)
```


We can also identify the ordering of z
```{r}
order(z)
```

i.e., the 2nd number is the min and the 1st number is the max

Additionally, we can idenify the maximum values this way:
```{r}
max(z)
```

**Subsetting**
Let's create a original object vector, x:
```{r}
x <- c(3, 4, 7)
x
```

Now, let's subset this vector and keep only the first three values
```{r}
x[-3]
```

Now, let's subset this vector and keep only the velues greater than or equal to 5
```{r}
x[x >= 5]
```

Notice that we did this using a logic statement `{r} >=`. Here is a list of other logica operators that you might find useful:

|Logic Operator|Meaning|
|! x | Is Not "x"|
|x & y| "x" and "y" (element by element) |
|x && y| "x" and "y" (across all elements)|
|x `|` y | "x" or "y" (element by element)|
|x `||` y | "x" or "y" (across all elments)|

You can learn more about this commands (`{r} help(Logic, package=base))


**Sampling**








First, let's create a sequence of numbers
```{r}
seq(1,3,length=5)

# Create the same sequence in a slightly different way:
seq(1,3,by=0.5)

# Create another sequence by going from 3 to 1:
seq(3,1,by= -0.5)
```

To randomly sample from an existing vector:
```{r}
sample(x,10,replace=T)
```

Or to randomly sample from a sequence of numbers from 1 to 500:
```{r}
sample(1:500,10,replace=F)
```
